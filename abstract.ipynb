    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a marketing context (controlled studies) -- marketing tactics can be seen as a \"treatment\" on a group of customers. The assignment of a voucher or gift certificate can, for example, increase consumption in an online shop when given to the right customer. The effectiveness of a voucher on customers given their other covariates (age, gender, previous purchases, search history, etc.) can determine the most profitable assignemnt in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "average treatment effect - does the voucher have any effect at all?\n",
    "conditional avearge treatment effect - groups with the highest CATE can be targeted in future marketing campaigns. \n",
    "\n",
    "marketing-adjacent applications : political campaigns, \"get-out-the-vote\" calls. The literature looks at observaitonal studies that measure the effectiveness of (the \"treatment\" of) \"get out the vote\" calls, reminding citizens to vote in elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### the role of machine learning in this: \n",
    "\n",
    "**figure out: why bother doing machine learning on the propensity score, can we not just figure out analytically given the sample, what the propensity score for each person is?**\n",
    "\n",
    "we can use machine learning to estimate the treatment effect of a campaign - though it may be interesting, we do not care about the functional form of the covariates effect on the outcome (buy on a website, vote in an election, attribute credit or blame to a candiate...), as we can not modify our sample in order to achive different results. we can only direct the treatment to where it will be most effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "!!!! insert blah blah blah on stacking and how great it is...\n",
    "\n",
    "if it is advantageous to use machine learning over purely econometric methods, then there is a role for ensemble methods in a treatment effects / causal machine learning context.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### literature review... \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nie, Wager** : on stacking, simulated data and test on political data. they have what they call the \"R-learner\" a novel way to combine machine learning models in order to determine the best treatment effect estimator (conditonal average treatment effects, i believe...)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grimmer et al**: also on stacking, uses a real dataset, (as i recall..) has a novel way of comparing a single-model estimate of a treatment effect to the ensemble version.\n",
    "uses (simulated??) data to compare the effectiveness of each model chosen (9 or 12 different methods of modelling) on differnt types of (more, less sparse, more less heterogenus, etc.) datasets.\n",

    "    a.) single models vs. stacking; do some models really work better on different kinds of data as shown in Grimmer et al. \n",
    "    b.) the accuracy of stacking on different types of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.) try to implement the R learner vs. bagging or somethig else, and on different underlying data?**  not sure either.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.) implement different kinds of \"studies\" on the data** - (from Nie & Wager)\n",
    "  \n",
    "    a.) lots of confounding of the covariates, but clear treatment effect. (EQUIVALENT TO R SCRIPT : theta_s)\n",
    "    b.) randomized trial ; generate data (skewed perhaps to some covariates?) and see how stacking works compared to single model.. (IN R SCRIPT : just the parameter random assignment.)\n",
    "    c.) \"easy propensity score and difficult baseline\" (WHAT IS THE DATA GENERATION PROCESS HERE AS IN R SCRIPT?)\n",
    "    d.) unrelated treatment and control arms - (ie no way to compare the treated and the untreated? HOW WOULD WE DO THIS EITHER?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "NB: from Nie & Wager in setups a and c, where there is complicated confounding that needs to be overcome before we can estimate a simple treatment funciton, some learners will stand out over others.\n"
